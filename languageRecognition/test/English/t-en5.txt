The strongest tools in Minecraft are now made of Netherite, an upgrade from Diamond gear.

As expected, Netherite items have higher durability than Diamond items, but they can also float in lava and they don’t burn, which is a huge plus.

Here’s how to upgrade your Diamond items to Netherite items:

    Get a Smithing Table, either by crafting one using Iron Ingots and planks or by stealing one from a village.
    Combine your Diamond item with a Netherite Ingot using the Smithing Table.

If you haven’t gotten a Netherite Ingot, that’s a bit tricky. You’ll need to go into the Nether and mine to find Ancient Debris. From there, you’ll have to smelt the Ancient Debris into a Furnace to get Netherite Scrap. You’ll need to combine four Netherite Scraps and four Gold Ingots in order to get one Netherite Ingot.

Since you’re upgrading your tools rather than making new ones from scratch, all your enhancements on your Diamond items will still be there once you upgrade to Netherite.

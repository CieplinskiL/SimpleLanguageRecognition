NHS figures reveal the number of people admitted to hospital as a result of allergies has more than doubled since 2013. There are estimated to be over 2 million people living with a diagnosed food allergy in the UK, according to the Food Standards Agency.

The rise in allergies over recent decades has been particularly noticeable in the West – England saw a 72 percent rise in the number of hospital admissions for children caused by anaphylaxis (an acute allergic reaction) between 2013 and 2019, from 1,015 to 1,746.

A food allergy is when the body’s immune system mistakenly treats proteins found in food as a threat. A severe reaction, known as anaphylaxis, can be life threatening. But it’s important to distinguish between allergies and intolerances, which are caused by difficulty digesting certain foods.

The increase in numbers is not simply because we’re more aware of allergies or getting better at diagnosing them, says Dr Alexandra Santos, Consultant in Paediatric Allergy. There are a number of high-profile theories about what’s behind this rise, ranging from lack of sunlight to dietary changes affecting our gut bacteria. While there’s no clear single reason for the increase, the cause is “most likely related to environmental factors and our lifestyle”, says Santos.

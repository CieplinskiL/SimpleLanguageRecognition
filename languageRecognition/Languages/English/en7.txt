ogecoin appears to be one of social media's favourite topics as it has been trending for a while now, mostly due to Musk's continuous tweets about it.

In 24 hours to Friday morning, Dogecoin jumped 112.89 percent, as per Coinbase, with the value of the cryptocurrency rising to $0.29, around 30 cents. This came just two days after it hit the milestone of 10 cents on April 14.

About Dogecoin and the sharp surge in its price

Launched in 2013, Dogecoin was initially created as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer and was never meant to be a successful cryptocurrency. Its creation was inspired by a trending dog meme, and hence was used and traded for a long time as a joke.
The cryptocurrency has recently emerged as one of the favourites of tech giants, social media influencers, and bigwigs across industries. Musk, who is seen as one of the most ardent supporters of Dogecoin, tweeted on February 4, 2021, "Dogecoin is the people's crypto." The tweet sent its value higher by 75%.

The Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex were seen talking together as they left the funeral of their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh.

The brothers spoke as they left St George's Chapel in Windsor, alongside the Duchess of Cambridge.

It is the first public meeting of the pair since Prince Harry stood down from royal duties more than a year ago.

Last month, Prince Harry hinted at ongoing difficulties between him and Prince William.

In an interview with Oprah, he said the two were on "different paths", and that "the relationship is 'space' at the moment".

On Saturday, the princes walked with their cousin Peter Phillips in between them, as they walked behind their grandfather's coffin on its short journey to the chapel.

It was nearly 24 years since the two brothers made a similar walk together at the funeral of their mother Diana, Princess of Wales.

At the funeral service, the 30 members of the congregation wore face masks and socially distanced in line with Covid restrictions, with the Queen seated alone.

Also alone, Prince Harry sat on the opposite side of the aisle to his brother and sister-in-law Catherine.
